# Thyroid Detection


***Thyroid disease is one of the most common disease with endocrine disorders in the human population today. For example, hyperthyroidism(over) and hypothyroidism(under), which are relate to release of amount of thyroid hormones the thyroid gland produces and whether it is overactiveTrusted Source (when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone) or underactiveTrusted Source (when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone). To solve this problem, to do effective classification and for better prediction we will use Machine Learning algorithms.***

### DataSet:-
I have take the dataset from kaggle. To dowload it [click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/yasserhessein/thyroid-disease-data-set?select=hypothyroid.csv)

Attributes:-

age: Age of the patient

sex: Sex of the patient

on_thyroxine: Having thyroxine problem or not?

query_on_thyroxine: Has query on thyroxine?

on_antithyroid_medication: Medication is going on or not?

sick: Sick or not ?

pregnant: Pregnant or not ?

thyroid_surgery: Have thyroid surgery or not ?

l131: I-131 is used in medicine to diagnose and treat cancers of the thyroid gland.

I131_treatment: If having l131 treatment ?

query_hypothyroid: Has query on hypothyroid ?

query_hyperthyroid: Has query on hypothyroid ?

lithium: Lithium may cause hyperthyroidism due to thyroiditis or rarely Graves' disease. As lithium inhibits thyroid hormone release from the thyroid gland it can be
used as an adjunct therapy in the management of severe hyperthyroidism.

lithium: Having lithium theraphy?(Lithium may cause hyperthyroidism due to thyroiditis or rarely Graves' disease. As lithium inhibits thyroid hormone release from the thyroid gland it can be used as an adjunct therapy in the management of severe hyperthyroidism.)

goitre: Having hoitre or not? (A goiter is typically not dangerous, unless the underlying cause of thyroid enlargement is a thyroid cancer.)

tumor: Having tumor ?

hypopituitary: Having hypopituitary? (In hypopituitarism, there is an absence of one or more pituitary hormones. Lack of the hormone leads to loss of function in the gland or organ that it controls.)


psych: Having psychiatric problems? (The more severe the thyroid disease, the more severe the mood changes(anxiety or depression).)

TSH_measured: Measured ? 

TSH  : TSH stands for thyroid stimulating hormone. A TSH test is a blood test that measures this hormone. TSH levels that are too high or too low may be a sign of a
thyroid problem. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. TSH normal values are 0.5 to 5.0 mIU/L.)


T3_measured: Measured? 

T3: A T3 test is most often used to diagnose hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the body makes too much thyroid hormone. T3 tests are frequently ordered with T4
and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) tests. A T3 test may also be used to monitor treatment for thyroid disease. The range for normal values are: Total T3 -- 60 to
180 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL), or 0.9 to 2.8 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L)

TT4 measured: Measured ?

TT4: Thyroxine, also known as T4, is a type of thyroid hormone. A T4 test measures the level of T4 in your blood. Too much or too little T4 can be a sign of thyroid
disease. There are two forms of T4 in your blood: Free T4 is the active form of thyroxine hormone that enters your tissues where it's needed. A typical normal range
is 0.9 to 2.3 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL), or 12 to 30 picomoles per liter (pmol/L).

T4U measured: Measured ?

T4U: T4 results that are higher than normal may be a sign of: Hyperthyroidism, which may be caused by Graves disease or another medical condition that causes
your thyroid to make too much T4. Thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) Toxic goiter (an enlarged thyroid with areas that make extra thyroid hormone)

FTI measured: Measured ?

FTI: Free thyroxine index is calculated by dividing the total T4 by the TBI value (T-uptake ratio). Interassay precision (CV) is <5%. Reference range for T-uptake ratio
is 0.7–1.2 and for FTI is 6–11.00 μg/dL. The FTI is a normalized determination that remains relatively constant in healthy individuals and compensates for abnormal
levels of binding proteins. Hyperthyroidism causes increased FTI, and hypothyroidism causes decreased values.

TBG measured: Measured ?

TBG: Thyroxine binding globulin. The TBG blood test measures the level of a protein that moves thyroid hormone throughout your body.
