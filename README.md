# ThyroidData_Model


***Thyroid disease is one of the most common disease with endocrine disorders in the human population today. For example, hyperthyroidism(over) and hypothyroidism(under), which are relate to release of amount of thyroid hormones the thyroid gland produces and whether it is overactiveTrusted Source (when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone) or underactiveTrusted Source (when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone). To solve this problem, to do effective classification and for better prediction we will use Machine Learning algorithms.***
